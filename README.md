# README Generator

## Description

This is an application that is to make a README file to be generated over the course of multiple questions being asked to the USER. When the user chooses their title, description, installation steps, usage, licenses (if applicable), the rules of contributing, tests, and contacts if there are questions. When every question is asked and a response is given then the README file is then created for the USER to be able to use as their own README file.
